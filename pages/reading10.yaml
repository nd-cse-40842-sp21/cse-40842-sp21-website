  ## Reflections
  
  For this week, we will be reading the autobiography of [Linus Torvalds], whom
  many consider the ultimate [hacker]:

  > And I basically sat in front of a computer for four years... My order was
  always the same: a Coke and a doughnut... Yes, I was definitely a geek.  No
  question about it... So I would be sitting in front of a computer and be
  perfectly happy.

  For this upcoming week, you are to consider the following questions as you
  perform the readings and participate in class:

  1. In what ways did [Linus Torvalds]'s upbringing resemeble yours?  In what
  ways was it different?  What elements of his childhood contributed to his
  development as a [hacker]?

  2. What drove [Linus Torvalds] to create his own operating system?  What was
  his original motivation?  What resources did he have?  Who did he work with?
  How much planning or how serious did he take his endeavor?

  3. What *itch* do you currently have?  That is, what sort of problem or
  project do you wish you could solve... just for fun?

  Note, you should not simply list the questions and answer each one directly.
  Instead, the questions are there to help you brainstorm about the question:

  > Do you find the story of [Linus Torvalds]' upbringing and creation of
  [Linux] inspiring, interesting, or irrelevant?  How does his story compare to
  other computing luminaries such as [Bill Gates] or [Steve Jobs]?  What do you
  wish your story to be?
