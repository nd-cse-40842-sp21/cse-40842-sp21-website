  ## Readings

  The readings for this week are:

  1. [King of the Ball](https://archive.org/details/justforfun00linu/mode/2up)
  
  ## Reflections

  In this week's readings, [Linus Torvalds] discusses the early days of [Linux]
  and how it grew into an overnight success:

  > The announcement launched Linux into the above-the-radar zone in Finland,
  and it started generating publicity elsewhere, too.  A lot of the early
  headlines came about because some journalist had stumbled over Linux and got
  excited about it...  It was far more attention than I had expected initially.

  For this upcoming week, you are to consider the following questions as you
  perform the readings and participate in class:

  1. What sort of growing pains did [Linus Torvalds] face in the early days of
  [Linux] and how did he deal with them?

  2. [Linus Torvalds] views himself as somewhat counter-cultural in that he
  disagreed with the typical mindset present in Silicon Valley over issues such
  as work-life balance and job stability.  Discuss these differences and how
  [Linus Torvalds] differed with both [Bill Joy] and [Steve Jobs] on various
  issues related to open source and operating systems..

  3. Finally, discuss how [Linus Torvalds] dealt with success.  How does he
  define success in regards to [Linux]?  

  Note, you should not simply list the questions and answer each one directly.
  Instead, the questions are there to help you brainstorm about the question:

  > What do you make of [Linux]'s success?  Is it proof of the power of
  [hackers] in the **bazaar**?  Or was it simply a matter of fortunate
  circumstances?  Will there ever be another [open source] success story as big
  as [Linux]?
