  ## Readings

  The readings for this week are:

  1. [Homesteading the Noosphere](http://www.catb.org/~esr/writings/cathedral-bazaar/homesteading/)

  ## Reflections

  In this essay, [ESR] discusses the culture and customs of the [open source]
  community:

  > Cultures are adaptive machines. The open-source culture is a response to an
  identifiable set of drives and pressures. As usual, the culture's adaptation
  to its circumstances manifests both as conscious ideology and as implicit,
  unconscious or semi-conscious knowledge. And, as is not uncommon, the
  unconscious adaptations are partly at odds with the conscious ideology.

  For this upcoming week, you are to consider the following questions as you
  perform the readings and participate in class:

  1. Considering [ESR]'s analysis of the open source culture and customs, what
  drives people to participate in open source?  What benefit do they derive in
  giving away their code?

  2. What do you make of [ESR]'s list of taboos:

        > - There is strong social pressure against forking projects.
        >
        > - Distributing changes to a project without the cooperation of the
        moderators is frowned upon.
        >
        > - Removing a person's name from a project history, credits, or maintainer
        list is absolutely not done without the person's explicit consent.

      Considering open source history, do these ring true?  Are these good
      taboos or norms for the culture to have or do they violate the spirit of
      open source?

  3. This semester we've discussed the idea of what a hacker is and whether or
  not you consider yourself one.  Considering [ESR]'s description of the *gift
  economy* and the role of **reputation**, do you find these mechanisms and
  motivations appealing?  Do you view participation in open source as a means
  of "ego satisfaction" or something more?  What would entice you or motivate
  you to participate?

  Note, you should not simply list the questions and answer each one directly.
  Instead, the questions are there to help you brainstorm about the question:

  > What motivates or drives people to contribute to open source? What prevents
  people from doing so?  What is required to sustain a healthy community?
