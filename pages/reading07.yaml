  ## Readings

  The readings for this week are:

  1. [A Brief History of Hackerdom](http://www.catb.org/esr/writings/homesteading/hacker-history/)

  2. [The Cathedral and the Bazaar](http://www.catb.org/~esr/writings/cathedral-bazaar/cathedral-bazaar/)

  ## Reflections

  In these essays, [ESR] discusses [the Cathedral and the Bazaar]:

  > No quiet, reverent cathedral-building hereâ€”rather, the Linux community
  seemed to resemble a great babbling bazaar of differing agendas and
  approaches ... out of which a coherent and stable system could seemingly
  emerge only by a succession of miracles.

  For this upcoming week, you are to consider the following questions as you
  perform the readings and participate in class:

  1. What are the difference between the **cathedral** model of software
  development and the **bazaar** style of software enigeering.  Which models
  have you experienced?  Which one do you prefer?

  2. In his [The Cathedral and the Bazaar], [ESR] enumerates **19** principles
  such as:

      > 1: Every good work of software starts by scratching a developer's personal itch.

      and

      > 6: Treating your users as co-developers is your least-hassle route to
      rapid code improvement and effective debugging.

      From your experience with software development, which of these principles
      ring true?

  3. [ESR] ends [The Cathedral and the Bazaar] by saying:

      > Perhaps in the end the open-source culture will triumph not because
      cooperation is morally right or software ``hoarding'' is morally wrong
      (assuming you believe the latter, which neither Linus nor I do), but
      simply because the closed-source world cannot win an evolutionary arms
      race with open-source communities that can put orders of magnitude more
      skilled time into a problem.

      What do you make of this? Has [open source] or the **bazaar** model won?
      Is it the future of software development?

  Note, you should not simply list the questions and answer each one directly.
  Instead, the questions are there to help you brainstorm about the question:

  > From your experience, which model of software development is superior: the
    **cathedral** or the **bazaar**?  Which is the future of software
    development?  Are the two models mutually exclusive?
